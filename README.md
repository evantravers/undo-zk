# Undo ZK

I used
[plaintext-migration](https://github.com/evantravers/plaintext-migration) to
bring everything into a ZK ID style Zettelkasten, now I think I want to
experiment with putting it back in another format ðŸ¤£

I have been using a ZK in Obsidian.md in the format:

## Features

- [Transformation](#transformation) from a ZK-id format to a Simpler, more
  creating-friendly format.
- Sorting a flat system into folders for GTD contexts/areas. (In my case, by
  tag.)
- Grepping through everything and creating `[[wikilink]]` references to bible
  verses.
- A transformation script for fixing the Markdown Bible content generated by a
  (modified version of) [Joe Buhlig's
  fork](https://github.com/joebuhlig/BibleGateway-to-Obsidian) of [Selfire1's
  work](https://github.com/selfire1/BibleGateway-to-Obsidian).

## Transformation

### Before

filename: `202103612458-kabob-case-filename.md`
content:

```markdown
---
id: 202103612458
title: Kabob Case Filename
aliases: ["Kabob Case Filename"]
---

# Kabob Case Filename

Here is the note itself, with #tags and suchery. It uses a YAML frontmatter,
trying to put all the metadata in the content of the file.

```

### After

filename: `Title With Spaces.md`
content:

```markdown
---
aliases:
  - Optional Aliasing
tags:
  - #simpler
  - #easier
---

Here is the note itself, with #tags and suchery. It uses a YAML frontmatter,
trying to put all the metadata in the content of the file. Because it uses a
standard title, I don't have to use the `aliases` feature to make Backlinks
work anymore.

- I'm going to write some blog posts on this.
